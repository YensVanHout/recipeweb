      This is a hobby project I created because I never know what to eat.<br />
      So I decided to make an application where I could store my favourite
      recipes.<br />
      When I really dont know what to eat I want to get a random recipe and get
      to cooking.<br />
      <br />
      Currently I am looking to add a login system so only authenticated people
      can add or remove recipes.
